 Solving the following problem from free code camp:

 probability that a random draw of 4 balls will contain at least 1 red ball and 2 green balls? While it would be possible to calculate the probability using advanced mathematics, an easier way is to write a program to perform a large number of experiments to estimate an approximate probability.

For this project, you will write a program to determine the approximate probability of drawing certain balls randomly from a hat.

First, create a Hat class in prob_calculator.py. The class should take a variable number of arguments that specify the number of balls of each color that are in the hat. For example, a class object could be created in any of these ways:
